Fix interpretation difference of the pure-Python and the Cython-based
HTTP parsers construct a ``yarl.URL`` object for HTTP request-target.

Before this fix, the Python parser would turn the URI's absolute-path
for ``//some-path`` into ``/`` while the Cython code preserved it as
``//some-path``. Now, both do the latter.
